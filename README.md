# Job Board Web Scrape & Analysis

The purpose of this project was to create a web scraper that could pull and parse data related to specific searches on a job board, store the extracted data in local database files, and conduct a high-level data analysis on the overall data collected. The current use case involved pulling data from Indeed related to different data-related roles and compare the results between them.
